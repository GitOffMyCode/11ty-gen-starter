## Why you should respect frogs

There is evidence that frogs have roamed the Earth for more than 200 million years, at least as long as the dinosaurs.
<br />
<br />
Small frogs eat insects such as flies and moths, as well as snails, slugs and worms. They use long tongues and sticky saliva to catch prey that passes them by.
<br />
<br />
Frogs can actually breathe through their skin. It's very thin, allowing oxygen to pass through when the frog is underwater. They can also breathe through the lining of their mouths. They do have lungs, but only use them when they need to top up their oxygen levels.
